          <h2>Luis Navarro.</h2>
          <h3>I create exceptional digital experiences.</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a web designer and WordPress developer with an engineering and
            cybersecurity background. I design and build beautiful sites that
            are minimalist in design with bold elements. Currently, I'm focused
            on helping local businesses create websites that serve their needs.

            Hello there! I'm Luis and I am based out of San Antonio, Texas.
            <br /><br />
            I hold a B.B.A. in Computer Information Systems from Texas A&M
            University-San Antonio, in addition to an A.S. in Engineering and an
