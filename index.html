About 
I was first introduced to coding in middle school, and then again in high school.  I took an introductory course to coding in college, which I also found interesting.  I like how these courses, along with math, allowed me to develop ways to solve problems. Code the Dream is the first program that I have attended for official coding instruction.
Experience
I am currently enrolled in Code the Dream, where I am developing skills as a coder.
