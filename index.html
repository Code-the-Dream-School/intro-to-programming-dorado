About

I am a 42 year old man from Indiana living in San Francisco CA. I speak intermediate Spanish and I have traveled Latin America extensively. I have worked in finance and as a music educator. 

Exprerience

I began studying Computer Science in 2022 at Berkeley Computer Technologies Program. Then I took an HTML bootcamp, a CSS bootcamp, and a JS mini bootcamp. Then I took a Java bootcamp however I had to suspend this because I needed to get up to speed with Git and GitHub. I then found a tutor from India to work with me every weekday morning on coding fundementals and dev tools. Then I enrolled in Code Tenderloin and completed their Job Readiness, Pre Code Ramp, and Code Ramp courses and became a volunteer TA. Then I began online classes for preparing to take Comptia A+ Core 1 and Core 2 Certifications. In October I will take the Core 1 test. Then I enrolled in Code The Dream and I am trying to complete the Intro Dorado class in time to be accepted to the Node and React classes in October. I am also involved with Code The Dream as a Student Leader. Lastly, I have been accepted to Rithm School which is a 16 week bootcamp for Web Development, though I am not sure how I can afford it. Along the way I have also taken the following courses on Linkedin Learning:
