<h1>About</h1>
I think I was drawn toward a career in tech because as a librarian I am always thinking about research and processes. I always want to improve and shorten the amount of time it takes to find the answers to things. I have been like this since I was a child. I would have dictionary and encyclopedia races with friends when those used to be in books then when my first job was at a library when I was 16; people would call and ask interesting questions and I would race the other workers to find answers. However, I always thought about the way that we found the answers and how we could improve the experience for our library patrons.
I took my first Information Architecture class in 2009 but it was my last course of my Library and Information Science career. It made perfect sense to me. As someone who thinks of music by genre, sub-genre, and sub-sub-genre I loved thinking of the hierarchies and scaffolding of Information Architecture.

<h1>Experience</h1>
I worked as a school librarian for five years in two states helping so many wonderful students. I was a coach for Academic Team and Future Problem Solvers. I then moved abroad and received my CELTA certification to teach English as a Second Language to Adults through Cambridge. Upon coming back to the US I taught refugees, scholars, wives, and others looking to improve their English. I then remembered the other half of my Master's degree and that Information Architecture class. I also thought about being the only woman in my Intro. to Programming class in 2003. I was accepted into Code the Dream and have been working to learn multiple coding languages. I am also working toward my Professional Diploma in UX Design.
