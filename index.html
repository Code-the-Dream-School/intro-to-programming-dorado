    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>My name is Scott Williams. My journey is just begining in this field. I became interested in Software Engineering in 2018 when I mistakingly hit the F12 buttton on the keyboard. This opened dev tools (which I was unaware of at the time) and I thought I hacked into the system. I didn't know how I got there and was curious about what I was looking at. I opened up a separate screen and looked up what it was. From there I was hooked. I looked around to find out how I can learn this new found love and found a few resources that pointed me in the right directtion. <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp.org</a> set me on the road to learning about web development.     </p>
