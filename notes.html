<!--
   To push the a new branch, first the 3.1 branche needed to be merge with/from whatever content
   in this case, in the terminal I make sure I was in branch 3.1
   Then I type
   git merge lesson-2-1

   Now to push 3.1 branch into github
    write a message then commit

    Idieally you want to start with a div right after the body to manage the structure
    better in a simple html

    ul : are for dot in the li
    ol : are numbered li
